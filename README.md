## 📊 **Scenario 1 vs 2 vs 3**

| **Criteria**                         | **Scenario 1**<br>*(M&S pulls data into their AWS)*   | **Scenario 2**<br>*(Faclon push data into our AWS DB)* | **Scenario 3**<br>*(M&S query their AWS DB live)*       |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Ownership**                   | ✅ Full (we own copied data)                        | ✅ Full (we own the DB receiving the data)            | ❌ None (data remains with third party)                  |
| **Real-Time Availability**           | ❌ Delayed (based on fetch frequency)                | ✅ Near Real-Time (writes are instant)                 | ✅ Real-Time (read directly from live DB)                |
| **Historical Analysis**              | ✅ Full control over retention                       | ✅ Full (long-term retention possible)                 | ❌ Depends on third-party exposure/window                |
| **Analytics Flexibility**            | ✅ High (data stored locally, joins allowed)         | ✅ High (full query freedom on our DB)                | ⚠️ Limited (only exposed views or APIs)                 |
| **ETL Complexity**                   | ⚠️ Medium (requires scheduled jobs, error handling) | ✅ Low (they handle ingestion)                         | ✅ None (just read, no ETL needed)                       |
| **Storage Cost (to us)**            | 📈 Medium to High                                   | 📈 Medium to High                                     | 📉 Low to None                                          |
| **Compute Cost (to us)**            | 📈 Medium (ETL + query processing)                  | 📈 Medium (queries on our DB)                        | 📉 Low (mostly dashboard compute)                       |
| **Infra Ownership**                  | ✅ Our environment                                  | ✅ Our environment                                    | ❌ None (external infra)                                 |
| **Dependency on 3rd Party Uptime**   | ✅ Decoupled (once fetched, we're safe)             | ⚠️ Medium (if they stop pushing, data halts)          | ❌ High (we’re fully dependent on their live DB)        |
| **Security Control**                 | ✅ Full (KMS, IAM, VPC, access policies)             | ✅ Full (but must trust write access)                  | ❌ None (limited control, must trust 3rd party config)   |
| **Change Risk (Schema/API Updates)** | ⚠️ Medium (requires mapping changes)                | ⚠️ Medium (needs validation during writes)            | ❌ High (our dashboards can break without notice)       |
| **Data Quality & Validation**        | ✅ Done during ingestion                             | ⚠️ Shared (validate on write)                         | ❌ No control (we accept what is exposed)               |
| **Latency (for dashboard)**          | ⚠️ Medium (based on poll interval)                  | ✅ Low latency                                         | ✅ Low latency                                           |
| **Scalability**                      | ✅ Good with batching & lake integration             | ✅ Scalable but can strain DB if unregulated           | ⚠️ Limited (depends on 3rd party infra & query limits)  |
| **Compliance & Auditing**            | ✅ Easy to audit (data in our systems)              | ✅ Full control, easier for audits                     | ❌ Limited (audits depend on 3rd party)                  |
| **Monitoring & Alerting**            | ✅ Easy (track ingestion, storage, freshness)        | ⚠️ Shared (we must monitor 3rd-party writes)         | ❌ Hard (no visibility into upstream issues)             |
| **Best For**                         | Historical reporting, trend analysis, archival      | Real-time dashboards + archival                       | Lightweight live monitoring, status boards              |
| **Worst For**                        | Real-time monitoring, if delays are critical        | Low-trust environments, high budget constraints       | Deep analytics, long-term insights, or regulated setups |
| **Operational Complexity**           | ⚠️ Medium (ETL maintenance + fetch logic)           | ⚠️ Medium (access control + trust boundaries)         | ✅ Low (no ops overhead, but risky)                      |
| **Vendor Lock-In Risk**              | ✅ Low (we control infra)                           | ⚠️ Medium (tight write integration with their logic)  | ❌ High (our dashboards break if access is revoked)     |

## 🏁 Summary of Each Scenario

| **Scenario**                                | **Strengths**                                                                                                | **Limitations**                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario 1**<br>*We fetch & store data*  | ✅ Great for long-term control, reliability, trend analysis<br>✅ Flexible architecture, decoupled from vendor | ❌ Not real-time<br>⚠️ Higher engineering maintenance & data duplication                 |
| **Scenario 2**<br>*They write into our DB* | ✅ Ideal for real-time dashboards<br>✅ We fully own the DB and analytics pipeline                            | ❌ High trust needed<br>⚠️ We pay for infra and must monitor ingestion carefully        |
| **Scenario 3**<br>*We query their live DB* | ✅ Simple, cost-efficient, and lightweight<br>✅ Real-time metrics with no infra burden                        | ❌ Fully dependent on third party<br>⚠️ No control over schema, uptime, or data policies |
